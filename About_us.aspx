<h3>1. THE  RENT A CODER PLATFORM.</h3>
<br />
1.1 Purpose of the RENT A CODER Platform.
<br />
<br />
The RENT A CODER Platform matches Clients and Contractors so they can buy and sell Services online. Under this Agreement, RENT A CODER provides services to both Clients and Contractors, including curating Clients and Contractors, facilitating the formation of contracts between Clients and Contractors, and managing disputes related to those contracts. Clients post jobs and invite Contractors to apply. Contractors post profiles and bid on jobs. If a Client and Contractor agree on terms, a Service Contract is formed directly between such Client and Contractor subject to the provisions set forth in Section 3 (Service Contract Terms Between Client and Contractor). RENT A CODER pays Contractors in connection with their delivery of services through the RENT A CODER platform. RENT A CODER collects payment from Clients in connection with their receipt of services through the RENT A CODER platform.
<br />
<br />
<br />
1.2 Eligibility.
<br />
<br />
The RENT A CODER Platform is available only to legal entities and persons who are at least eighteen (18) years old and are otherwise capable of forming legally binding contracts under applicable law. User agrees that User is not (a) a citizen or resident of a country in which use or participation is prohibited by law, decree, regulation, treaty or administrative act; (b) a citizen or resident of, or located in, a country or region that is subject to U.S. or other sovereign country sanctions or embargoes; or (c) an individual or an individual employed by or associated with an entity identified on the U.S. Department of Commerce's Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the Department of State's Debarred Parties List or otherwise ineligible to receive items subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, or other economic sanction rules of any sovereign nation.

<br /><br />

<h3>2. RENT A CODER GENERAL USER POLICIES</h3>
<br /><br />
2.1 RENT A CODER Fees.
<br /><br />
RENT A CODER charges Contractors a fee for the services of connecting them with the Clients that hire them and collecting payment for work. Typically, this fee is equal to 10% of Client’s payments, plus a fee for disbursements. If Contractor elects disbursement through a third party, the third party may assess additional fees. If Contractor elects disbursement in foreign currency, RENT A CODER adds a conversion fee of 1.5% to the spot rate quoted by its foreign exchange vendor.
<br />
<br />
2.2 General User Obligations.
<br />
You will not access (or attempt to access) the Site by any means other than the interface provided, and you will not use information from the Site for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was made available. You will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the functioning of the Site. You will not upload or attach an invalid or malicious or unknown file. You will not insert any external links that may be malicious or unknown to you, or used for offering any goods or services other than Services.
<br /><br />
2.3 Identity and Account Security.
<br />
RENT A CODER reserves the right to validate User information at any time, including but not limited to validation against third party databases or the verification of one or more official government or legal documents that confirm the User's identity. You authorize RENT A CODER, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries necessary to validate your identity and confirm your ownership of your email address or financial accounts. Failure to provide information about you and your business when requested is a violation of this Agreement. The User is solely responsible for ensuring and maintaining the secrecy and security of the User’s RENT A CODER account password. User agrees not to disclose this password to anyone and shall be solely responsible for any use of or action taken through the use of such password on RENT A CODER. You must notify RENT A CODER Support immediately if you suspect that your password has been lost or stolen. By using your RENT A CODER User account, you acknowledge and agree the RENT A CODER’s account security procedures are commercially reasonable.
<br /><br />2.4 Disbursements to Contractors
<br />
RENT A CODER will automatically disburse funds to Contractors according to the payment instructions on file with RENT A CODER no more than one month after funds become payable (or within six months, for amounts less than $100). Funds become payable to Contractors working on Hourly Contracts following the expiration of the dispute period and the security period associated with each work week. Funds become payable to Contractors working on Fixed Price Contracts after Clients accept work submitted by a Contractor. Clients retain the ability to change the terms of a Fixed Price Contract, including the amount of money owed on a Fixed Price Contract, until they accept the work. Contractors may ask RENT A CODER to expedite payments. RENT A CODER reserves the right to refuse any such request and may assess a processing fee in connection with such a request.
<br /><br />2.5 Disintermediation.<br />

Client shall make all payments relating to, or in any way connected with, a Service Contract (including, without limitation, bonuses) through the RENT A CODER Platform. Any action that encourages or solicits complete or partial payment outside of the RENT A CODER Platform is a violation of this Agreement. Should a Client be found in violation of this section of this Agreement, it will owe RENT A CODER an amount with respect to each Service Contract equal to the greater of a) $2,500; or b) the applicable fees had the payments been processed through the RENT A CODER Platform, plus 18%.
<br /><br />2.6 Buyout.<br />

Notwithstanding the provisions set forth above, Users may agree to provide or receive Services outside of the RENT A CODER Platform with Users identified through RENT A CODER. If the Services are rendered more than three (3) years after the Client identifies the Contractor through RENT A CODER, no RENT A CODER Fees or buyout provisions apply. If Services are rendered outside of RENT A CODER less than three (3) years after the Client identifies the Contractor through RENT A CODER, payments for such Services will not be subject to the RENT A CODER Fees, provided that the Client pays RENT A CODER a "Buy-Out" amount in accordance with the procedure set forth below:
Prior to contracting outside of RENT A CODER to receive Services from a User identified through the RENT A CODER system, the Client will notify RENT A CODER in writing of its intent to pay the Buy-Out fee in lieu of the RENT A CODER Fees.
The Client will provide a good faith estimate of the then anticipated amount to be paid to the Contractor for such Services during the fifty-two week period immediately following the date of such notice.
The Client will pay or authorize RENT A CODER to deduct from its account the greatest of (i) fifteen percent (15%) of the good faith estimate described above; (ii) fifty-two (52) times the "Average Weekly RENT A CODER Fees" (as defined below); or (iii) five hundred dollars ($500). For purposes of the foregoing, the "Average Weekly RENT A CODER Fees" means the average weekly amount of RENT A CODER Fees that became due to RENT A CODER based upon work performed for Client by the Contractor over the four (4) weeks immediately preceding the buy-out notice described above, not counting any weeks in which no RENT A CODER Fees became due.
<br /><br />2.7 Non-payment.<br />

If Client fails to pay amounts due under this Agreement, whether by cancelling Client’s credit card, initiating an improper chargeback, or any other means, Client’s RENT A CODER account will be suspended, no additional payments will be processed, and any work-in-progress will be stopped. Without limiting other available remedies, Client must reimburse RENT A CODER for amounts due upon demand, plus any applicable processing fees, charges or penalties, plus interest at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum allowed by law, plus attorneys’ fees and other costs of collection as allowed by law. In its discretion, RENT A CODER may setoff amounts due against other amounts received from or held for Client, make appropriate reports to credit reporting agencies and law enforcement authorities, and cooperate with them in any resulting investigation or prosecution.
<br /><br />2.8 Hold on funds.<br />

In cases of fraud, abuse or violation of this Agreement, the RENT A CODER Payment Guarantee shall be revoked and all monies due to the Contractor may be held and/or reclaimed, not just those from the Contract(s) under investigation.
<br /><br />2.9 Dispute Resolution Policy.<br />

For Hourly-Rate Contracts only, Clients may dispute hours during the dispute period following the close of a weekly invoice period. It is the Client’s responsibility to review the Work Diary and Time Log of every Service Contract on a weekly basis and to file any disputes on a timely basis. Once the dispute period has passed, the charges are accepted by the Client and can no longer be disputed and can only be refunded by the Contractor. Disputes can only address the hours billed, not the quality of the work performed or deliverables. RENT A CODER will promptly investigate the Time Log to determine, in its sole discretion, whether an adjustment is appropriate. RENT A CODER's determination shall be final.
2<br /><br />2.10 Enforcement of Agreement and Policies.<br />

RENT A CODER has the right, but not the obligation, to suspend or cancel your access to the RENT A CODER Platform if it believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement or violated our rights or those of another party. Without limiting RENT A CODER's other remedies, we may suspend or terminate your account, use self-help in connection with our rights to reclaim any available funds, and refuse to provide any further access to the RENT A CODER Platform to you if (a) you breach any terms and conditions of this Agreement or other written policies and procedures posted on the Site; (b) we are unable to verify or authenticate any information you provide to us; or (c) we believe that your actions may cause legal liability for you, our Users or for RENT A CODER. Once suspended or terminated, you MAY NOT continue to use the RENT A CODER Platform under a different account or reregister under a new account. If you attempt to use the RENT A CODER Platform under a different account, we reserve the right to reclaim available funds in that account and/or use an available payment method to pay for any amounts outstanding. In addition, violations of this Agreement may be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and may result in additional penalties and sanctions. When your User account is canceled, you may no longer have access to any parts of the RENT A CODER Platform, including data, messages, files and other material you keep on RENT A CODER.
<br /><br /><br />
<h3>3. SERVICE CONTRACT TERMS BETWEEN CLIENT AND CONTRACTOR.</h3>
<br /><br />
Unless otherwise agreed to in a writing signed by both Client and Contractor, the terms and conditions of the Service Contract are as set forth in Sections 3.1 through 3.12 below (“Standard Terms”). Client and Contractor may not agree to any other terms and conditions that affect the rights or responsibilities of RENT A CODER.
<br /><br />
3.1 Services.
<br />
Contractor shall perform Services in a professional and workmanlike manner and shall timely deliver any agreed-upon Work Product.
<br /><br />3.2 Agency.<br />

Work performed on Hourly-Rate Contracts under a Contractor's profile must be performed by the Contractor represented. If the Contractor wishes to subcontract with third parties to perform Services on behalf of the Contractor on Hourly-Rate Contracts, the Contractor must do so as an Agency. Contractor and Agency agree and acknowledge that Agency's employees or contract personnel are not employees of RENT A CODER or Client. Agency is solely responsible for all wages, costs, and expenses of Agency's employees or contract personnel and has the sole and exclusive right to supervise and control them. Agency acknowledges and agrees that neither it, nor any of its employees or agents, shall have any claim under this Agreement for overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker's compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits of any kind from RENT A CODER or Client.
<br /><br />3.3 Client Payments and Billing.<br />

Client shall pay the agreed-upon amount for time spent (under Hourly-Rate Contracts) or the approved project (under Fixed-Price Contracts). Contractor agrees that it will be paid solely by RENT A CODER and Contractor will not have any recourse against Client if Contractor is not paid by RENT A CODER. For Hourly-Rate Contracts, Client is billed for hourly Contractor Fees on a weekly basis. For bonuses, milestone payments and Fixed-Price payments, Client is billed immediately.
<br /><br />3.4 Termination of a Service Contract.<br />

Under Hourly-Rate Contracts, either party may terminate the Service Contract at any time for any or no reason. However, the Client remains obligated to pay for any time the Contractor worked prior to termination.
For Fixed-Price Contracts, the Client may terminate at any time but may not recover any payments already made. The Contractor may terminate a Fixed-Price Contract at any time if no payment has been made. If a payment has been made on a Fixed Price Contract, the Contractor may terminate only with the Client’s consent or after the payment has been refunded.
<br /><br />3.5 Client Deliverables.<br />

Client grants Contractor a limited, non-exclusive, revocable (at any time, at Client’s sole discretion) right to use the Client Deliverables as necessary for the performance of the Services. Client reserves all other rights and interest, including, without limitation, all Proprietary Rights, in and to the Client Deliverables. Upon completion or termination of the Service Contract, or upon written request by the Client, Contractor shall immediately return all Client Deliverables to the Client and further agrees to purge all copies of Client Deliverables and Work Product contained in or on Contractor's premises, systems, or any other equipment otherwise under Contractor's control. Within ten (10) days of Client’s request, Contractor agrees to provide written certification to the Client that all Client Deliverables have been returned or purged.
<br /><br />
3.6 Work Product.<br />

Proprietary Rights in Work Product shall be owned by Contractor until payment has been made by Client, at which time Contractor will be deemed to have assigned all Proprietary Rights in the Work Product to Client. For Hourly-Rate Contracts, Client must pay for all hours that qualify for the Payment Guarantee. For Fixed-Price Contracts, Client has complete and sole discretion whether and how much to pay; however, if Client does not pay in full, Contractor may terminate the Service Contract by refunding any partial payment, and Contractor will retain Proprietary Rights in Work Product. To the extent that under applicable law, Proprietary Rights cannot be assigned, Contractor hereby irrevocably agrees to grant, and hereby grants, to Client an exclusive (excluding also Contractor), perpetual, irrevocable, unlimited, worldwide, fully paid, and unconditional license to use and commercialize Work Product in any manner now known or in the future discovered. To the extent such license grant is not fully valid, effective or enforceable under applicable law, Contractor hereby irrevocably agrees to grant, and hereby grants, to Client, such rights as Client reasonably requests in order to acquire, as close as possible, all rights equivalent to full legal ownership. In order to ensure that Client will be able to acquire, perfect and use such Proprietary Rights, Contractor will: (i) transfer possession, ownership, and title to media, models, and other tangible objects containing Work Product to Client, including delivery of a complete copy of the source code for any software, documented in sufficient detail to enable a reasonably skilled programmer to correct, integrate and modify it; (ii) sign any documents at Client’s request to assist Client in the documentation, perfection and enforcement of its rights; and (iii) provide Client with support and reasonable access to information for recording, perfecting, securing, defending, and enforcing such Proprietary Rights in any and all countries. In the case that under applicable law, Contractor retains any rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal and any other rights that may be known as or referred to as "moral rights" (collectively "Moral Rights") or other inalienable rights to Work Product or Confidential Information under this Agreement, Contractor irrevocably agrees to waive, and hereby waives, all such rights, or, to the extent Contractor cannot waive such rights, Contractor agrees not to exercise such rights, until Contractor has provided prior written notice to Client and then only in accordance with any reasonable instructions that Client issues in the interest of protecting its rights. Contractor’s obligations under this Section 3.6 will continue even after Contractor deregisters from or ceases use of the RENT A CODER Platform. Contractor appoints Client as Contractor’s attorney-in-fact to execute documents on Contractor’s behalf for the purposes set forth in this Section 3.6.
<br /><br /><br />
<h3>4. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS BY USER OF RENT A CODER'S ROLE.</h3>

<br />

<br /><br />4.4 RENT A CODER as a Limited Agent
<br />

User hereby appoints RENT A CODER as its agent for the limited purpose of executing documents that confirm User’s activities on the RENT A CODER Platform. RENT A CODER will act on User’s behalf and in a clerical capacity, without in any way restricting RENT A CODER’s rights or expanding RENT A CODER’s obligations under this Agreement or any Service Contract. Each User appoints RENT A CODER as its agent to execute an Act of Acceptance or equivalent instrument on the User’s behalf documenting payments made or to be made to Contractors or to RENT A CODER, if another User so requests.
<br /><br /><br /><h3>5. INVOICES AND PAYMENT METHODS.</h3><br /><br />
5.1 Formal Invoices and Taxes.
<br />
RENT A CODER shall have no responsibility for determining the necessity of or for issuing any formal invoices, or for determining, remitting, or withholding any taxes applicable to Contractor Fees. Instead, Contractor shall be solely responsible for determining whether it is required by applicable law to issue any formal invoices for the Contractor Fees and for issuing any invoices so required. Contractor shall also be solely responsible for: (a) determining whether Contractor or RENT A CODER is required by applicable law to remit to the appropriate authorities any value added tax or any other taxes or similar charges applicable to the Contractor Fees, and remitting any such taxes or charges to the appropriate authorities on behalf of itself or RENT A CODER, as appropriate; and (b) determining whether RENT A CODER is required by applicable law to withhold any amount of the Contractor Fees, notifying RENT A CODER of any such requirement and indemnifying RENT A CODER (either by permitting RENT A CODER to offset the relevant amount against a future payment of Contractor Fees or by refunding to RENT A CODER the relevant amount, at RENT A CODER’s sole discretion) for any requirement to pay any withholding amount to the appropriate authorities. RENT A CODER shall have the right, but not the obligation, to audit and monitor Contractor’s compliance with applicable tax laws as required by this Section 5.1. Further, in the event of an audit of RENT A CODER, Contractor agrees to promptly cooperate with RENT A CODER and provide copies of Contractor’s tax returns, and other documents as may be reasonably requested for purposes of such audit.
<br /><br />5.2 Payment Methods.
<br />
Client hereby authorizes RENT A CODER to run credit card authorizations on all credit cards provided by Client, to store credit card details as Client’s method of payment for Services, and to charge Client’s credit card (or any other form of payment authorized by RENT A CODER or mutually agreed to between Client and RENT A CODER). RENT A CODER may, in its sole discretion, deviate from its typical billing cycle for Hourly-Rate Contracts and charge Client for any and all Time Logs at any time.
<br /><br />5.3 Payment Guarantee.
<br />
RENT A CODER guarantees payment to Contractors working on Hourly-Rate Contracts where the Client has a verified payment method, the time represented is captured online using the RENT A CODER Team software, the work performed and captured pertains directly to the Service Contract billed, and each Time Log is annotated with appropriate work memos describing the work performed. Determination of whether these criteria have been met is at the sole discretion of RENT A CODER. The Payment Guarantee will not apply to Contractors or Contracts in violation of this Agreement, where the Contractor is aware of or complicit in another User’s violation of this Agreement, or where there is any other involvement in fraudulent activities or abuse of this Payment Guarantee.

<br /><br /><br />6. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.
<br /><br />
RENT A CODER MAKES NO EXPRESS REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THE SERVICES, WORK PRODUCT, RENT A CODER PLATFORM OR ANY ACTIVITIES OR ITEMS RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, RENT A CODER DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SECTION STATES USER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AGAINST RENT A CODER WITH RESPECT TO ANY DEFECTS, NON-CONFORMANCES OR DISSATISFACTION.
<br /><br /><br />
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
<br /><br />
IN NO EVENT WILL RENT A CODER BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT COSTS OR DAMAGES, LITIGATION COSTS, INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL COSTS, OR LOSS OF DATA, PRODUCTION OR PROFIT. THE LIABILITY OF RENT A CODER TO ANY USER FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF: (A) U.S. $2,500; AND (B) ANY RENT A CODER FEES RETAINED BY RENT A CODER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACTS ON WHICH USER WAS INVOLVED AS CLIENT OR CONTRACTOR DURING THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE CLAIM. THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO ANY LIABILITY, ARISING FROM ANY CAUSE OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH COSTS OR DAMAGES AND EVEN IF THE LIMITED REMEDIES PROVIDED HEREIN FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
8.1 Term.

<br /><br />
8.2 Termination.
<br />
Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, effective immediately upon written notice to the other party (or by terminating or suspending User’s account), provided, that any such termination for convenience shall not affect the validity of any Service Contracts that have been executed prior to termination and this Agreement shall continue to apply with respect to such Service Contracts.
<br /><br />8.3 Consequences of Termination.
<br />

Subject to Section 2.9 (Dispute Resolution Policy), RENT A CODER shall pay Contractor, in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 (Invoices and Payment Methods), for all time recorded in the Time Logs incurred prior to the effective date of the termination.
<br /><br />8.4 Survival.
<br />

<br /><br /><br /><h3>9. GENERAL.</h3><br /><br />
8.1 Entire Agreement.<br /><br />

This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to its subject matter and cancels and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations, warranties, and other communications between them.
<br /><br />9.1 Side Agreements.<br />

Section 8.1 notwithstanding, Clients and Contractors may enter into any supplemental or other written agreement that they deem appropriate (e.g., confidentiality agreement, work for hire agreement, assignment of rights, etc.). The terms and conditions of this Agreement, however, will govern and supersede any term or condition in a side agreement that purports to expand RENT A CODER's obligations or restrict RENT A CODER's rights under this Agreement.
<br /><br />9.2 Compliance.<br />

User shall not violate any laws or third party rights on or related to the RENT A CODER Platform. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, User agrees to comply with all applicable import and export control laws and third parties' Proprietary Rights.
<br /><br />9.3 Notices: Consent to Electronic Notice.
<br />
You consent to the use of (a) electronic means to complete this Agreement and to deliver any notices pursuant to this Agreement; and (b) electronic records to store information related to this Agreement or your use of the RENT A CODER Platform. Notices hereunder shall be invalid unless made in writing and given (a) by RENT A CODER via email (in each case to the email address that you provide), (b) a posting on the RENT A CODER Site or (c) by you via email to support@RENT A CODER.com or to such other addresses as RENT A CODER may specify in writing. The date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
<br /><br />9.4 Modifications.<br />

No modification or amendment to this Agreement shall be binding upon RENT A CODER unless in a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of RENT A CODER. For the purposes of this Section 11.5, a written instrument shall expressly exclude electronic communications such as email and electronic notices but shall include facsimiles.
<br /><br />9.5 No Waiver.<br />

The failure or delay of either party to exercise or enforce any right or claim does not constitute a waiver of such right or claim and shall in no way affect that party's right to later enforce or exercise it, unless such party issues an express written waiver, signed by a duly authorized representative of each party.
<br /><br />9.6 Assignability.<br />

User may not assign this Agreement, or any of its rights or obligations hereunder, without RENT A CODER's prior written consent in the form of a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of RENT A CODER (and, for the purposes of this Section 11.7, a written instrument shall expressly exclude electronic communications such as email and electronic notices but shall include facsimiles). RENT A CODER may freely assign this Agreement without consent of User. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section will be null and void. Subject to the foregoing restrictions, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties.
<br /><br />9.7 Severability.<br />

If and to the extent any provision of this Agreement is held illegal, invalid, or unenforceable in whole or in part under applicable law, such provision or such portion thereof shall be ineffective as to the jurisdiction in which it is illegal, invalid, or unenforceable to the extent of its illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability, and shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to conform to applicable law so as to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties. The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction shall not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any other provision in any jurisdiction.
<br /><br />9.8 Choice of Law.<br />

This Agreement and any controversy, dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including by not limited to a Service Contract, ("Claims") shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions and excluding the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
<br /><br />9.9 Dispute Resolution; Arbitration; Personal Jurisdiction and Venue.<br />

RENT A CODER and User hereby agree that any Claims shall first be settled through negotiation or according to the Dispute Resolution Policy set forth in Section 2.9 above. If a Claim (other than a Claim for injunctive or other equitable relief) remains unresolved by these means, either party will have the right to demand binding non-appearance based arbitration by a third party service mutually agreed upon by the parties. A final judgment will be made by the arbitrator, which must be adhered to by both parties and by RENT A CODER, as applicable. You agree that any Claim you may have against RENT A CODER, if not resolved as set forth above, must be resolved by the California state courts of San Mateo County (or, if there is exclusive federal jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California). You hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.
<br /><br />9.10 Prevailing Language.
<br />
The English language version of this Agreement shall be controlling in all respects and shall prevail in case of any inconsistencies with translated versions, if any.
