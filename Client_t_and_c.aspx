<h3>2. Job Posts</h3>
<br />


Great work begins with a great job post. Effective posts are professional, written in English, and accurately describe the services requested.<br />
All job posts must adhere to these policies:<br />
Posts may not share or solicit direct contact information prior to interview.<br />
Jobs must be free of offensive language and advertisements.<br />
Posting the same job multiple times is prohibited.<br />
Requesting a service that is illegal or violates intellectual property rights, copyrights or the terms of service of another service, <br />
product or website is prohibited.<br />
Requesting free work of any kind is prohibited, including contests in which contractors submit work with no to very little pay, and only <br />
the winning submission is paid the full amount.<br />
Requesting a fee in order to apply or bid is strictly prohibited.<br />
Job posts may not request the creation of sexually explicit content, or involve modeling or acting.<br />
If a job requires exposure to content of an adult or potentially offensive nature, it must notify potential readers in the title of the job 
post.<br />
Requesting the creation of content that violates academic integrity is prohibited.
Jobs must be free of spammy content.<br /><br />
<br />
<h3>3. RENT A CODER Guarantee</h3>
<br />
The RENT A CODER Guarantee is our promise that an hour worked is an hour paid, and an hour paid is an hour worked. It’s our way of showing <br />
respect for the work getting done on RENT A CODER.<br />
(Please note that the RENT A CODER Guarantee does not apply to fixed-price projects or manual time. For more details and other limitations, <br />
see section 5.4 of the RENT A CODER User Agreement.)<br /><br />
<h3>4. Disputes</h3><br />

Disagreements occasionally arise in every workplace, both online and off. On RENT A CODER, clients may dispute time worked on hourly <br />
contracts during the four days following the close of a weekly invoice period (from the end of the workweek on Sunday at midnight UTC <br />
through the following Thursday).
The most common reasons for disputes include:<br />
Manual time billed without approval
Low activity levels or insufficient work memos as tracked by the RENT A CODER Time Tracker
Screenshot reflects activity not associated with the work being billed
Just as with a traditional employee, only the time worked—not the quality of the work—is up for dispute. Please take a minute to <br />
familiarize yourself with our official dispute process.
<br /><br /><h3>5. Payments</h3><br />

Soliciting or processing payment outside of RENT A CODER is prohibited for the safety and security of all RENT A CODERers. If a contractor solicits <br />
work to be done and paid for outside of the RENT A CODER platform, please report them immediately.
For more information, please see Section 2.4.3 of the RENT A CODER User Agreement.
<br /><br /><h3>6. Feedback</h3>
<br />
Feedback that is honest and objective contributes to a vibrant and productive workplace. The best feedback focuses on the facts, <br />
while providing helpful information to both the recipient and the community as a whole.<br />
We do not monitor, censor, or investigate feedback. However, on very rare occasions, we may delete ratings and feedback found to 
violate our User Agreement or the content guidelines below. Attempts to falsify feedback, manipulate, or coerce another user by 
threatening negative feedback are strictly prohibited, as is any offer to sell or buy services in exchange for positive feedback.
Feedback containing the following types of content may be removed or edited:
Spam, advertising or other commercial content
Content that endorses illegal activity
Content that personally identifies another user
Political, religious, or social commentary rather than a genuine comment regarding the work experience
Profane, vulgar, obscene, slanderous, libelous, threatening or discriminatory language, or adult material
